This project will be your first steps into AI and Machine Learning. You're going to start with a simple, basic machine learning algorithm. You will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

## Mandatory part
Implement a linear regression algorithm on a single element, the mileage of a car. To do this you must implement 2 programs:
* The first program will be used to predict the price of a car based on its mileage. When you launch the program, it will ask you for mileage and should give you an approximate price of the car.
* The second program will be used to train your model. It will read the data set and make a linear regression on this data.

## Bonuses
* View the data on a graph.
* Display the line resulting from your linear regression on this same graph and see if it works!
* Display the curve resulting from your cost history.
* A program that checks the accuracy of your algorithm.

## Install
This project uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Python](https://programwithus.com/learn-to-code/install-python3-mac/). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

Use the package manager pip3 to install all needed packages.
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install sklearn
```

## Usage
```
python3 ft_linear_regression.py [flags]
python3 priceEstimation.py
```

## Flags
```
-p, --prediction            - show the prediction curve
-ch, --cost_history         - show the cost history curve
-cd, --coef_determination   - show the coefficient of determination
```
